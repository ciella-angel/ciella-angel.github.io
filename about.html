  <p> My name is Ciella Angel-Lalanne and I am a rising junior in High School that is passionate about healthcare! Ever since my grandfather has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s I have watched him progress through the extreme ups and downs of the disease, and have noticed the immense impact the disease has on mental health. Through school I am involved in science research, and in the process of reaching out to scientists neurologists have told me how little attention goes to the emotional effects of Parkinson’s, and how these effects can have the most dramatic impact on quality of life. </p>
